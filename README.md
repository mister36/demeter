Demeter is a DeFi protocol that enables self-paying loans, or, viewed in another lens, advances on yields. Demeter is a unique product offering that solves three problems:

1. Many real world businesses still lack access to institutional capital

2. Long term crypto holders cannot access liquidity without incurring costs and losing exposure to their investment upside.

3. Crypto yields have become less appealing than private credit & other off-chain returns

Our protocol allows crypto investors to open a collateralized debt position that maintains a 200% collateralization ratio (i.e., 50% LTV ratio). The collateral will be deposited into one of several vaults, each investing the funds into a Real World Asset protocol. The yield generated from each strategy will decrease usersâ€™ debt obligations.

Demeter provides several intriguing properties:

* Debt pays itself
* No liquidations or interest payments
* No need to swap crypto and lose upside for RWA lending
* Yield uncorrelated to crypto ecosystem
* Connect to real-world borrowers

Once borrowers borrow against their collateral, they are issued a synthetic token pegged to the underlying collateral. These synths can be swapped for the underlying asset in a liquidity pool, and the peg is maintained through the arbitrage opportunity between pool mispricing and debt repayment (as Demeter treats synths as 1:1 with the underlying in repayments).
